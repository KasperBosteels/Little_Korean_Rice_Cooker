## About The Project

If you are a frequent visitor of the discord chat servers, you might already know that there are a ton of bots for a million different tasks.

altho this project was started as just an educational project for my programming skills, it has grown a special place in my heart, and i've been developing it on and off for more than 2 years now.


Why would you get this bot for your server?
Here's why:

* This bot has very easily accessable configuration.
* This bot likes to have fun just like you.
* There are a ton of fun commands you can try out.
* Progression!!
* Slash commands are soon to be supported.

I hope you consider running or inviting my bot, i am always open for questions or feature suggestions.

## Built With

* discord.js/voice
* oxford api
* urban dictionary api

* The discord token can be created in [the discord developers platform](https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fdevelopers%2Fapplications)

* The sql keys you will need to create on your own after installing mysql on a device

* The oxford keys can be attained from the [oxford dictionaries api website](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/) you will need to create an account there and follow the simple instructions there.

* For the programmable search engine (the CSE_ID) you will need to create one in [googles programmable search engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/) dashboard
* For the google-api key you will need to create a new project in the [google cloud platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/home)
and get the google_api key from there.
