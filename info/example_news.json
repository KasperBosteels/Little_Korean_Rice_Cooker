Angeführt wird die Runde von einem Investorenkonsortium rund um die französische Kapitalanlagegesellschaft Andrea Partners aus Paris und MIG Capital aus München, bekannt als Gründungsinvestor von Biontech. Scirhom wurde 2016 in München gegründet, um neue Behandlungsmöglichkeiten für Autoimmunkrankheiten und andere gesundheitliche Probleme zu entwickeln. Das von Scirhom entwickelte Antikörperprogramm SR878 zielt auf ein spezielles Molekül namens iRhom2 ab; iRhom2 ist ein Haupttreiber für Entzündungen im menschlichen Körper. Eine erste Indikation ist unter anderem rheumatoide Arthritis. Scirhom arbeitet in diesem Zusammenhang eng mit dem Hospital for Special Surgery in New York zusammen, einem Zentrum für Rheumatologie. Der von Scirhom patentierte Wirkstoff SR878 mehrere entzündungs und krankheitsfördernde Prozesse gleichzeitig blockieren, ohne dabei wichtige Funktionen des Körpers zu beeinträchtigen. So sollen nützliche Signalwege im Körper wiederhergestellt und die Immuntoleranz verbessert werden. Das Unternehmen hofft, dass der Wirkstoff aufgrund seiner gezielten Wirkung ein gutes Sicherheitsprofil aufweist. Therapien für Autoimmunerkrankungen sind ein Milliardenmarkt Bei Therapien für Autoimmunerkrankungen handelt es sich um einen Milliardenmarkt – Humira von Abbvie war lange Jahre beispielsweise das umsatzstärkste Medikament der Welt, heißt es in der Pressemitteilung von Andrea Partners und MIG Capital. Das frische Kapital wird laut Pressemitteilung des Unternehmens in den klinischen Wirksamkeitsnachweis des Entwicklungsprogramms fließen und, Zitat, „den therapeutischen Wert der patentierten iRhom2Strategie“ ausbauen. Die erste klinische Studie mit dem Wirkstoff SR878 soll demnach in der zweiten Jahreshälfte 2024 in Österreich beginnen. Dabei soll zunächst die Sicherheit des Wirkstoffs bei gesunden Probanden untersucht werden. Dem vorausgegangenen waren präklinische Studien an Tiermodellen. Im Juni 2024 hatte das Unternehmen seine CTAZulassung bekannt gegeben. Lest auch Rising Stars Megatrend Biotech: Dieser Investor kennt fünf Startups mit blendenden Aussichten ScirhomMitgründer und COO Jens Ruhe sagte anlässlich der neuen Finanzierungsrunde, man habe sich seit der Gründung 2016 als „führend“ im Bereich der auf iRhom2 abzielenden Biopharmazeutika etabliert. Er verwies auf den starken Patentschutz des SR878Wirkstoffes, mit dem man jetzt „den nächsten Schritt“ gehen wolle, „um Patienten zu erreichen, die bessere Autoimmunbehandlungen benötigen.“ Dem Investorenkonsortium gehören neben Andrea Partners und MIG Capital die Neuinvestoren Kurma Partners, Hadean Ventures und Wellington Partners an. Weiterhin beteiligt sind der Neuinvestor Bayern Kapital sowie die Bestandsinvestoren, darunter HighTech Gründerfonds (HTGF) und PhiFund Ventures. Im Rahmen der Beteiligung schafft Scirhom Platz für fünf neue Aufsichtsräte von Andera Partners, Kurma Partners, Hadean Ventures, MIG Capital und Wellington Partners.

Nun wollen einige im Internet Geld für die Shirts. Frankfurt – Am Sonntag, 14. Juli, entscheidet sich, wer FußballEuropameister 2024 wird. Fest steht schon jetzt: Weder Titelverteidiger Italien noch Gastgeber Deutschland werden sich im Berliner Olympiastadion die Krone aufsetzen. Für viele DFB Fans ist das Turnier nach der bitteren Pleite gegen Spanien im Viertelfinale nun quasi beendet. Manche von ihnen werden ihr nächstes Fußballspiel wohl in zwei Jahren schauen, wenn die Weltmeisterschaft in den USA, Mexiko und Kanada steigt. Was soll man nun also mit dem Deutschlandtrikot machen, wenn man es erst 2026 wieder aus dem Schrank holen will? Und was ist ein Shirt wert, das man sowieso umsonst bekommen hat? Diese Frage stellen sich jetzt scheinbar einige DeutschlandAnhänger. Vor und während des Turniers verteilte das Vergleichsportal Check24 kostenlos ein Trikot im DeutschlandDesign, wenn man an ihrem EMTippspiel teilnahm. KleinanzeigenNutzer wollen bis zu 80 Euro für kostenloses Deutschlandtrikot von Check24 Da das OriginalShirt der NagelsmannElf mit Flock mehr als 100 Euro kostet, begnügten sich Millionen Deutsche mit dem GratisJersey. Für alle zwei Jahre Fanmeile reicht's, dachten sie sich offenbar. Schaut man sich dieser Tage die Wiederverkaufsbörse kleinanzeigen.de an, stellt man fest, dass so mancher aus Nichts Geld machen will. Auch Verkäufer aus Frankfurt und dem RheinMainGebiet bieten das Check24Shirt an. Die meisten von ihnen wollen „nur“ 25 bis 30 Euro haben – es gibt aber auch Forderungen von 50 Euro und mehr für das GratisTrikot. Stolze 80 Euro sogar will ein KleinanzeigenNutzer aus dem Frankfurter Gutleutviertel. Es handele sich bei dem Produkt um ein „begehrtes Sammlerstück“ und ein „Symbol für die unvergessliche Euphorie dieses Turniers“. Bleibt zu hoffen, dass sich auch 2026 noch genug Fans an das Viertelfinalaus von 2024 erinnern. Einen Käufer hat der Anbieter in über zwei Wochen noch nicht gefunden.",

            "content": "FDA move illuminates key role of telomere targeting as a viable therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment 07092024 11:02 AM CET | Business, Economy, Finances, Banking & Insurance Press release from: ABNewswire \"MAIA is one of the earliest pioneers of telomere targeting as a therapeutic strategy, and we share in the enthusiasm for the FDA approval of imetelstat for rare blood cancers originating in bone marrow. We have found that telomere targeting as a mechanism of action plays a key role in treating certain cancers, and we are studying this science in our Phase 2 trial of THIO in highrisk nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC),\" said Vlad Vitoc, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MAIA. In 2020, the biotech industry gained significant attention due to the rapid development and deployment of COVID19 vaccines by major companies like Pfizer, BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson. However, as the immediate crisis of the pandemic subsided and other global issues emerged, interest in the biotech sector waned. By late 2023 and early 2024, investors' focus shifted back towards biotech as major pharmaceutical companies began leveraging their capital to acquire smaller biotech firms. Despite a peak in the industry's index at 3,039.79 in February 2024, it experienced a 16% decline by April. Since then, there has been a modest recovery of about 6.8% in biotech stocks as of early July 2024. One biotech stock that we would like to draw your attention to is MAIA Biotechnology, Inc. (NYSE American: MAIA). As the landscape of cancer treatment continues to evolve, MAIA Biotechnology, Inc. (NYSE American: MAIA) is emerging as a standout player in the realm of immunotherapies targeting cancer's cellular aging mechanisms. With recent clinical advancements and regulatory validations, MAIA offers a promising opportunity for traders and investors keen on the biotech sector. Pioneering TelomereTargeting Therapies MAIA is at the forefront of developing telomeretargeting immunotherapies, a revolutionary approach that could redefine cancer treatment paradigms. The company's lead candidate, THIO, is a firstinclass telomeretargeting agent undergoing Phase 2 clinical trials (THIO101) for treating highrisk nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). THIO's mechanism involves interacting with telomerase, an enzyme present in over 85% of human cancers, to initiate rapid cancer cell death. Recent Clinical and Regulatory Milestones The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) recent approval of imetelstat for specific hematologic malignancies validates the clinical pathway that MAIA has been pioneering. This development not only bolsters confidence in telomeretargeting therapies but also highlights MAIA's role as an early innovator in this space. Dr. Vlad Vitoc, MAIA's CEO, expressed enthusiasm for this breakthrough, underscoring THIO's impressive efficacy in clinical trials, especially in patients resistant to traditional therapies. THIO: A Closer Look at the Clinical Development THIO's clinical development includes the THIO101 Phase 2 trial, a multicenter study aimed at evaluating its antitumor activity in combination with PD(L)1 inhibitors. This trial is particularly significant for patients who have shown resistance to firstline treatments, offering a new avenue for those with advanced NSCLC. The dual approach of THIO followed by immune checkpoint inhibitors could potentially lead to more durable and effective cancer treatment outcomes. Investment Considerations For investors and traders, MAIA represents an intriguing prospect within the biotech industry: Innovation Leader: MAIA's focus on novel telomeretargeting therapies positions it as a leader in cancer treatment innovation. Clinical Trials and Regulatory Approvals: Progress in THIO's clinical trials and the FDA's endorsement of similar therapies enhance MAIA's credibility and market potential. Potential Market Impact: With THIO positioned as a second or later line of treatment for NSCLC, MAIA taps into a significant market, targeting patients with few remaining options. Final Thoughts Investing in MAIA Biotechnology potentially offers more than just financial returns; it's an opportunity to support a company that could potentially change the cancer treatment landscape. As MAIA continues to advance its clinical trials and expand its therapeutic reach, the company is poised for growth, making it an attractive option for investors looking to diversify into highpotential, innovative biotech stocks.

            "content": "Beide Minister kommen aus derselben Partei. Beim Thema Versorgungssicherheit aber liegen Mona Neubaur und Robert Habeck nicht ganz auf einer Linie. NordrheinWestfalens Wirtschaftsministerin Mona Neubaur kritisiert die neue Kraftwerksstrategie von Bundeswirtschaftsminister Robert Habeck (beide Grüne) als unzureichend. „Es ist ein Schritt in die richtige Richtung, dass nun zusätzlich ein Ausschreibungssegment von zwei Gigawatt für die Umrüstung von Bestandskraftwerken auf einen Wasserstoffbetrieb vorgesehen ist“, sagte Neubaur der „Rheinischen Post“. Der leicht ausgeweitete Umfang von insgesamt 12,5 Gigawatt wasserstofffähiger Kraftwerkskapazität werde auch weiterhin nicht ausreichen, „um die zukünftige Deckungslücke im deutschen Stromsystem komplett zu schließen“. Die Ministerin der schwarzgrünen Landesregierung in NRW kritisierte außerdem, dass bislang nur Eckpunkte der geplanten Mechanismen der neuen Strategie vorliegen. Das Bundeswirtschaftsministerium müsse kurzfristig konkrete Regelungsvorschläge aufzeigen. Die Bundesregierung hat im Zuge des im Haushalt 2025 verankerten Wachstumspakets auch den Weg frei gemacht für eine Strategie zum Bau neuer Gaskraftwerke. Demnach sollen insgesamt 12,5 Gigawatt an Kraftwerkskapazität und 500 Megawatt an Langzeitspeichern ausgeschrieben werden. Im Februar war bei der Vorlage von Eckpunkten noch die Rede von 10 Gigawatt an Kraftwerkskapazitäten gewesen. Neue Gaskraftwerke, die später mit Wasserstoff betrieben werden, sollen künftig zur Absicherung der Stromerzeugung aus erneuerbaren Energien aus Wind und Sonne als Absicherung bereitstehen – in Zeiten von „Dunkelflauten“, wenn kein Wind weht und keine Sonne scheint.",

They are crucial components, as they directly influence the performance, comfort, and handling of the bike. Typically, bicycle tyres consist of several layers, including the outer rubber tread, the casing or body, and the inner tube. The tread is the part of the tyre that contacts the ground, providing grip and durability. It comes in various patterns and compositions tailored for different terrains and weather conditions. The casing, usually made of nylon, cotton, or other synthetic materials, provides structure and protection for the inner tube. The inner tube holds the air that inflates the tyre, contributing to its overall resilience and ride quality. Different terrains and riding conditions necessitate specialized tyre designs. Mountain bikers require tyres with aggressive treads and robust sidewalls to navigate rough trails and obstacles effectively. In contrast, road cyclists prioritize tyres with minimal rolling resistance and high grip for smooth, efficient rides on paved surfaces. Tyres designed for gravel, cyclocross, or commuting offer variations tailored to specific riding environments. Additionally, consumer preferences, influenced by factors such as fashion, aesthetics, and brand loyalty, drive tyre choices. Some cyclists prioritize specific brands known for quality, reliability, or performance, while others seek trendy designs or ecofriendly options. The rise of cycling as a sustainable mode of transportation has spurred demand for durable, punctureresistant tyres suitable for urban commuting and everyday use. Other than this, growing awareness about environmental sustainability influences tyre design and manufacturing processes. Manufacturers strive to reduce the environmental impact of tyre production by utilizing ecofriendly materials, optimizing resource utilization, and exploring recycling initiatives. Sustainable practices resonate with environmentally conscious consumers and contribute to a positive brand image. Moreover, intense competition among tyre manufacturers stimulates innovation and product differentiation. Companies invest in research and development to gain a competitive edge by introducing novel features, proprietary technologies, and unique selling propositions.

From 13 July for a \"limited time\" the exhibition will be shown at the Odysseum in Cologne. Besides the sarcophagus, the exhibition also features historical artefacts and a virtual reality tour through the temple of Abu Simbel. With more than 180 artefacts, many of which the museum says have left Egypt for the first time, the exhibition has already been shown in Paris and Sydney. The most important piece, the cedar coffin of Pharaoh Ramses II ( ca. 1303 to 1213 BC), was discovered during archaeological excavations in 1881 and is one of the most important archaeological artefacts in Egypt. Mummified animals, jewellery, royal masks and amulets will also be on display. The Ramses exhibition will be on display at the Odysseum Museum in Cologne. This is in Corintostraße 1 in CologneKalk. The tram stop \"KalkPost\", the SBahn stop \"Trimbornstraße\" and the bus stop \"Corintostraße\" are very close by and can be used to reach the museum by public transport. The museum also has a feebased underground car park at the rear of the building. The exhibition kicks off on 13 July and will continue until 5 January 2025. It will be open daily: Tuesday to Thursday from 11am to 7pm, Friday, Saturday, Sunday as well as during school holidays and on public holidays and long weekends from 10am to 8pm. The museum points out that there may be exceptions. More details can be found in the museum's online booking calendar. Tickets can already be purchased online in specified time slots. Admission prices: from 16 euros for children (aged five and over) and 22 euros for adults (aged 16 and over)  prices are higher depending on the month or day of the week. There are family and group tickets as well as concessions for senior citizens, schoolchildren and students. Tickets without a time slot (Golden Ticket) cost an additional amount. A visit typically takes between 60 and 90 minutes, depending on how much time you spend. What can visitors expect on the virtual reality tour? Another attraction of the exhibition is the virtual reality experience, where visitors take a seat in movable armchairs and experience an animated 360degree journey through the temples of Abu Simbel and the tomb of Nefertari. The experience lasts around 15 minutes and is recommended for children aged eight and over. An extra ticket for 15 euros is required, which can be booked online.
